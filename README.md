# .NET Exception Beutifier

Browser extensions for _beautifying_ the Yellow Screen Of Death (YSOD) using the awesome Bootstrap themes from Bootswatch.

Browsers supported:
- Chrome
- Opera
- Firefox (Planned)
- Opera (Planned)
- Safari (Planned)
- Internet Explorer (Unlikely)


TODO:
- Localise style references and trim down to mimimum requirements
- Reduce deplay in beautification
- Potentially support additional servers

## Disclaimer
I hope it does not need to be stated but these extensions are purely splashing a lick of paint over the standard .net error screen shown during development. The YOSD should never be seen in production and this repo will not aid in hiding it.
