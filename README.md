# .NET Exception Beutifier

Browser extensions for _beautifying_ the Yellow Screen Of Death (YSOD) using
the awesome Bootstrap themes from Bootswatch.

## Browsers supported: 
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/net-exception-beutifier/hmanakaaopnlofagmidhhcenkgecehld)
- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/net-exception-beutifier/)
- Firefox (Planned) 
- Opera (Planned)
- Safari (Maybe) 
- Internet Explorer (Unlikely)


### TODO: 
- Localise style references and trim down to mimimum requirements 
- Reduce deplay in beautification 
- Potentially support additional servers

### Disclaimer 
_I hope it does not need to be stated but these extensions are purely splashing a lick of paint over the standard .net error screen shown during development. The YOSD should never be seen in production and this repo will not aid in hiding it._
