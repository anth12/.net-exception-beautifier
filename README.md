#.net Exception Beutifier

Browser extensions for /beautifying/ the Yellow Screen Of Death (YSOD) using the awesome Bootstrap themes from Bootswatch.

Browsers supported:
- Chrome
- Firefox (Planned)
- Opera (Planned)
- Internet Explorer (Unlikely)

I hope it does not need to be stated but these extensions are purly splashing a lick of paint over the standard .net error screen shown during development. The YOSD should never be seen in production and this repo will not aid in hiding it.
